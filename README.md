## Overview
This is a demo made with Highstock library with some functionalities implemented for a friend's (Saroskiiiii!) project with ECGs involved.

### Features
* Lack of unnecessary labels, axes, margins, etc.
* Manual offset to each line so they are somewhat separated without using panes.
* Plotband drawing in three band levels. Clicking in one of them causes it to be drawn in the main chart in an animated fashion. Its positions are synchronized with main chart extremes.
* Plotband expanding in the main chart.
* Dynamic checkboxes depending on the number of signals for toggling their visibilities.
* Series' label with a fake line.
